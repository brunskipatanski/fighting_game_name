    /*didnt know how to create a text file in unity so comment here. i made soem changes...
     * i made the camera size 4.64, need it to be smaller for scrolling the stage. also made some fallback elements like ground and walls.
     * good if we cant load some assets or just need to test out shit like chars...*/

    /*note that 6.10.2023 we have mot yet implemented stage scrolling or upward scrolling as players go up, so they will see the backgrounds
     * end when camera is implemented*/

    // and we are using scenes in this project guys. each stage has theyr own scene. main menus and shit. dont need to make every part of the game on the same page/scene. Basic_FallBack_stage is for testing and fallback
